# ðŸŒ± Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator
A web application that estimates the basal metabolic rate and ideal caloric intake for individuals based on their weight, height, age, gender, and activity level. This tool helps users to understand their caloric needs for weight management, whether they aim to lose, maintain, or gain weight.

## What is BMR?
Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body requires at rest to maintain basic physiological functions, such as breathing, circulation, cell production, and nutrient processing. It represents the minimum amount of energy needed for your body to function when you are not performing any physical activity. BMR varies based on factors such as age, gender, weight, and height, and it typically accounts for about 60-75% of your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).

Understanding your BMR can help you determine how many calories you need to consume to achieve your weight management goals.


## Features
- **Input Fields**: Enter `weight`, `height`, `age`, and select `gender`.
- **Activity Level Selection**: Choose between `study`, `work` and `training` to assess the caloric expenditure.
- **Goal Selection**: Select weight management goals: `lose weight`, `maintain weight``, or `gain weight`.
- **Calculation**: The application calculates and displays the `Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)`, `caloric expenditure`, and `ideal calorie intake` based on user inputs.


## What I Learned
Throughout the development of the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculator, I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of some technical concepts in web development. I reviewed my knowledge of JavaScript, particularly in areas such as DOM manipulation and event handling.

I also improved my debugging techniques by identifying and resolving issues within the code, ensuring the application functioned correctly across different scenarios.

Overall, this little project enhanced my technical skills and understanding of web development principles.
